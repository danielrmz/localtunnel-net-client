localtunnel for windows
=======================

Install & Use
-------------
Download or git clone a copy of the repo, after that there are two ways to use the service:

* From the command line, go to LocalTunnel.Console/bin/Release/ and run:
   `localtunnel.exe port /path/to/publickey`

* UI-based, open LocalTunnel.UI/bin/Debug/LocalTunnel.UI.exe and enter the required info. I'll try to set up a frequent port jump list for Win7
