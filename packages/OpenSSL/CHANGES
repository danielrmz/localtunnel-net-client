OpenSSL.NET - CHANGES

0.5-rc1 [Apr 14, 2011]
* Updating to OpenSSL native library to version 1.0.0d
* Using Visual Studio 2010 project files 
  (I don't have the old versions of VS installed anymore)
* Removing EVP_md2(), the native library no longer includes this by default

0.4.4 [Jan 18, 2010]

* Added support for i2d_X509_bio() which allows for writing X509
  certificates in DER format.

0.4.3 [Oct 23, 2009]

* Added support for PKCS12_create().

0.4.2 [Oct 23, 2009]

* Replacing the prebuilt binaries for libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll with
  ones that come directly from the openssl source. This should fix
  problems people are finding in the wild, but it will also require
  them to install the MSVC 2008 CRT first.

0.4.1 [Sep 9, 2009]

* Including prebuilt binaries to libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll that are
  statically linked to the CRT instead of depending on the DLL CRT. 
  This should resolve the DllNotFoundException at startup.

0.4 [Aug 26, 2009]

* Thanks to Ben Henderson for contributing the wrapper for the SSL API!
* Lots of bug fixes mostly concerning memory management.
* Refactored the Base class to deal with memory mangement better.
* Default project build now produces assemblies specifically targetted for
  the x86 architecture, which works around issues with using the native
  DLL on 64-bit machines.
* Lots more XML comments/docs (no more compiler warnings!)
* Changes to namespace on most classes so it's easier to navigate them.
* Added unit tests for X509Certificate and CryptoKey (many more to go)
* Support for CE has been dropped due to lack of testing. Will add again
  once I have the ability to test it again.
* Added HMAC wrapper.

0.3.2 [Jun 01, 2008]

* Added wrapper and test for EVP_BytesToKey().
